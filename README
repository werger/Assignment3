In this assignment, we had to create a program that simulates a train route using queues.  The queue ADT implements a queue interface, station class creates a station and the passenger class creates a passenger.  The passenger class creates an id and a destination for the passenger.  When the queue is iterated though, random amounts of passengers get on at different stations and some get off at their designated locations.
